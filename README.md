Facebook Homework Week 1
========

Homework took 5-6 hours to complete, while looking at videos and talking to classmates. 
Xcode likes to crash along with debug errors I've never seen before. Had to talk to iOS dev friends for help.

Created the following:
 - created a container view and modify properties (color, font, text color, fooled around with corner radius, didn't touch shadow offset)
 - add buttons with different images, for default
 - Created UIimages using aspect fill, aspect fit.
 Created a UI Textfield with background image
 Add UI Labels with plain text and bolded text
 - Create a moving textfield when the keyboard appears
